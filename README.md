Problem Description

In high-frequency trading (HFT) systems, every microsecond counts. Efficient parallel task execution is critical to achieve low-latency processing. Your task is to implement a thread pool in C++ that can schedule and execute tasks concurrently with minimal overhead. The thread pool must:
	•	Create a fixed number of worker threads at construction.
	•	Allow clients to submit tasks that will be executed by the worker threads.
	•	Ensure that all tasks are completed before the thread pool is destroyed.
	•	Minimize per-task dynamic memory allocation and synchronization overhead.

Your implementation should be robust, thread-safe, and optimized for performance in a high-throughput, low-latency environment.

Requirements

Implement a thread pool with the following functionality:
	1.	Constructor
	•	ThreadPool(size_t numThreads): Initializes the thread pool by creating a specified number of worker threads.
	2.	Destructor
	•	Ensures that the thread pool stops accepting new tasks and that all queued tasks are executed before the pool is destroyed.
	3.	Task Submission
	•	Implement a function enqueue that accepts a task (a callable object) and its arguments, schedules it for execution, and returns a std::future representing the result of the task.
	4.	Shutdown (Optional)
	•	Optionally, implement a shutdown() method that immediately stops the pool from accepting new tasks and safely terminates the worker threads once the current tasks finish.

Constraints
	•	Thread Safety:
	•	The thread pool must be safe for use by multiple threads concurrently.
	•	Performance:
	•	Task submission and execution should run in amortized O(1) time.
	•	Minimize dynamic memory allocations per task.
	•	Minimize locking overhead (consider lock-free structures if possible).
	•	Scalability:
	•	The pool should be efficient for high-throughput systems like HFT, where tasks are lightweight and frequent.

Follow-Up Questions
	1.	Low Latency Optimizations:
	•	How would you further optimize the thread pool for ultra-low latency in an HFT environment?
	•	What techniques would you use to reduce contention (e.g., per-thread task queues, work stealing, or CPU affinity)?
	2.	Dynamic Resizing:
	•	How could you extend your thread pool to support dynamic resizing (increasing or decreasing the number of worker threads) without locks?
	3.	Advanced Scheduling:
	•	How would you implement task priorities within the thread pool?
	•	What changes would be necessary if tasks had dependencies?
	4.	Memory Model Considerations:
	•	Discuss the use of memory orderings (std::memory_order) in your synchronization primitives.
	•	How do these choices impact performance in a high-frequency trading system?
